# Project Goal: Autonomous 90‑Day Thai Pepper Grow

The purpose of this project is to maximize the chance of successfully growing two Thai pepper plants 100% unattended for 90 days. The intended operating procedure is:

- Run the script once to compute initial and refill dosing.
- Fill and dose the reservoirs per script output.
- Set the light timer.
- Plant the seeds.
- Leave the system unattended for 3 months, expecting harvestable peppers on return.

Implications for design and modeling:

- Favor robustness and stability over aggressive yield optimization.
- Model and account for uncertainty (environment and parameters) conservatively.
- Avoid early‑stage nutrient depletion; respect germination and slow initial growth.
- Keep refill composition constant and practical to prepare.
- Provide clear, actionable outputs suitable for a single setup session.
